### [GitHub Project](https://github.com/BAGLAT/Portfolio-Risk-Management)

Completed a project on portfolio risk management considering returns of four major investment banks during financial crisis (2008-2010) using Python. 

Stocks of following companies were taken in a portfolio:
1. Goldman Sachs
2. Citi
3. Morgan Stanley
4. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Working involves following modules:

1. Portfolio risk measures (VaR and CVaR) with varying confidence intervals.
2. Risk estimation techniques - Parametric, Historical and Monte Carlo Simulation.
3. Modern Portfolio Theory (Efficient Portfolio and Efficient Frontiers).
4. Optimizing portfolio weights with an objective function to reduce CVaR loss.
